# Subdomain Scanner

This is a simple Python script that scans a specified domain for common subdomains.

## Usage

To use this script, you must have Python 3 installed on your system.

    1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
    3. Run the following command:

   python subdomain_scanner.py example.com

Replace **example.com** with the domain you want to scan. 

The script will loop through a pre-defined list of common subdomains and attempt to resolve each one by appending it to the specified domain. If a subdomain resolves successfully, the script will output a message indicating that the subdomain was found.
